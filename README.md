# sueli drone

Sueli Drone is a tiny web app mimicking a radio widget.

It supports user defined alarms and it's mostly intended to play moody songs that would lull the user to a healthy night's sleep.

## Usage

Currently just ```npm run start``` for development

## Dependencies 

Parcel, React, ReactDOM, GSAP

## Misc 

```npx babel-upgrade``` could maybe be necessary for the latest Babel version to work.
